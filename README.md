# Cosmic Prisons Core (Remake)
*I have been working on this Cosmic Prisons remake from videos, the wiki, and memory. Most of the numbers behind cosmic are hidden, as always, so I had to take some guesses based on what I could see. This project is based around cosmic prisons during Soverign Map 5 (Early 2019)*
